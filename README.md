Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to use various machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical and demographic features. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and interpretation.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

Goal: Predict whether a patient has heart disease using their medical attributes.

Dataset: Heart Disease UCI dataset (Cleveland data)
